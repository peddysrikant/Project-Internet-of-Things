**Intuitive Hand Gesture Control**

By including a Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) accelerometer into the system, this project presents a novel method of controlling wheelchairs. A key component is the MEMS accelerometer, which enables users to control the wheelchair's movement with slight hand movements. The goal of the project is to create an intuitive and responsive control system that will improve mobility for those with physical limitations.

Using MEMS technology, the proposed system precisely tracks hand gestures and converts them into signals for wheelchair navigation. Tilting the hand along the y-axis allows users to control motion in both directions, rotation is accomplished by tilting the hand along the x-axis. With this method, wheelchair control will be accessible, adaptive, and user-friendly to accommodate different degrees of mobility disability.

The project places a strong emphasis on user-centric design throughout the development phase to make sure the glove that integrates the MEMS accelerometer fits in smoothly with customer preferences and lifestyles. Testing in the real world with people who have physical limitations is essential for improving the system based on user input and creating a wheelchair control system that is more accessible and easy to use.

Achieving a high degree of accuracy in hand movement interpretation, prioritizing user comfort and adaptability, and resolving accessibility issues are important goals. In addition to being a technological innovation, the MEMS accelerometer controller wheelchair project seeks to dramatically enhance userÂ quality of life by providing a revolutionary and helping kind of mobility.
