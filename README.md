This project introduces an innovative approach to wheelchair control by integrating a Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) accelerometer into the system. The MEMS accelerometer serves as a key component, allowing users to manipulate the wheelchair's movement through subtle hand gestures. The project focuses on developing a responsive and intuitive control mechanism that enhances mobility for individuals with physical disabilities. 

The proposed system leverages MEMS technology to accurately capture hand movements, translating them into precise commands for wheelchair navigation. Users can control forward and backward motion by tilting their hand along the x-axis, while rotation is achieved through tilting along the y-axis. This approach aims to provide a user-friendly, adaptive, and accessible means of wheelchair control, catering to varying levels of mobility impairment. 

Throughout the development process, the project emphasizes user-centric design, ensuring the glove integrated with the MEMS accelerometer aligns seamlessly with users' lifestyles and preferences. Real-world testing involving individuals with physical disabilities plays a pivotal role in refining the system based on user feedback, contributing to a more inclusive and user-friendly wheelchair control solution. 

Key objectives include achieving a high level of accuracy in interpreting hand movements, prioritizing user comfort and adaptability, and addressing accessibility challenges. The MEMS accelerometer controller wheelchair project not only represents a technological advancement but also aims to significantly improve the quality of life for users by offering a transformative and empowering means of mobility
